## Abstract
    > In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the demand for energy as a result of the exponential rise in the use of electronic devices. Consequently, countries across the world are increasing their energy supply to meet this demand. However, developing countries like Iraq struggle to balance the supply and demand of electricity due to limited power generation capabilities. This results in an unstable power supply, which has a ripple effect on various sectors of the economy. As a solution, forecasting supply and demand levels can help stabilize the power supply, power security, improve energy efficiency, and environmental benefits. These effects are important because they can help the Iraqi government achieve its long-term energy goals and contribute to the overall development of the country. This study uses Iraq as a case study to forecast the supply and demand of electricity. The dataset used was obtained from the Ministry of Electricity in Iraq for the years 2019-2021, and it consists of time series data. We used six well-known algorithms, including LSTM, TCN, MLP, Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest, to forecast power supply and demand. These algorithms employ different approaches ranging from deep learning to advanced statistical methods. Our experiments determine the best model to use for four prediction horizons, corresponding to 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours ahead. Our research not only helps address Iraq's energy problems, but also lays a foundation for future research in the field, ultimately fostering economic growth and improving the lives of the country's inhabitants.
